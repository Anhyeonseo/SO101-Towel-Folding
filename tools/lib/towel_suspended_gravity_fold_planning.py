"""Plan a gravity-canonicalized first fold for the dual SO-101 arms.

The previous first-fold arc tried to turn a flat panel over while the cloth
was already in table/self contact.  That can trap an internal Z fold.  This
candidate changes the cloth topology before the precision laydown:

1. pinch the robot-near edge at both endpoints;
2. lift vertically until the complete free edge clears the table;
3. accelerate the suspended panel away from the robot, then keep moving it
   forward while lowering so inertia trails and straightens the free edge;
4. continue moving the held edge away from the robot, depositing a
   deliberately larger supported lower layer with a no-tension allowance;
5. reverse the arm direction and lay the shorter held layer over it without
   recovering that allowance.

Mid-fold top-view imagery cannot reliably separate the vertical panel from the
table-contacting panel.  The route therefore uses the known grasp-to-free-edge
length and a small open-loop allowance instead of a hidden-boundary estimate.

Only task-space poses are produced here.  Cloth contact, free-edge vision,
MoveIt collision checking, and execution authorization remain separate gates.
